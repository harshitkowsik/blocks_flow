# Blocks Flow

**Blocks Flow** is a minimalist, interactive web application that demonstrates the flow and movement of blocks within a grid. Designed as a visual and educational tool, it showcases fundamental front-end development skills using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is ideal for those interested in animation, DOM manipulation, and creative coding.

## Project Overview

Blocks Flow visually represents the dynamic movement of colored blocks within a grid layout. The application is fully client-side, with all logic and styles contained in three simple files. It is suitable for learning about:

- DOM manipulation
- Grid layouts
- CSS transitions and animations
- Interactive UI development

---

## Features

- **Animated Block Movement:**  
  Blocks move or flow across the grid, creating visually appealing patterns.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The layout adapts to different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile viewing.

- **Lightweight & Fast:**  
  No dependencies or frameworks—just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Educational Value:**  
  The codebase is concise and easy to read, making it perfect for beginners.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5** — Structure of the grid and blocks
- **CSS3** — Styling, layout, and transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Animation logic and user interaction

## File Structure


---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/harshitkowsik/blocks_flow.git
    cd blocks_flow
    ```

2. **Open the Application:**
    - Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

3. **Explore:**
    - Watch the blocks flow and interact as designed.
    - Modify the code to experiment with different animations or layouts.

---

## How It Works

- **Grid Initialization:**  
  The HTML sets up a container for the grid. JavaScript dynamically creates and manages the block elements.

- **Animation Logic:**  
  The script moves blocks across the grid using either CSS transitions or JavaScript-based position updates.

- **Styling:**  
  CSS handles the grid layout, block appearance, and smooth transitions.

---

## Customization

- **Colors & Styles:**  
  Edit `style.css` to change block colors, grid size, or animation speed.

- **Block Behavior:**  
  Modify `script.js` to experiment with different movement patterns, speeds, or user interactions.

- **Grid Size:**  
  Adjust the number of rows/columns in the JavaScript to create larger or smaller grids.
